At [The App Business](https://theappbusiness.com) we believe that writing clean, clear, and consistent code forms the foundations of every great app we build. One of the ways we ensure we do this is with our coding style guides. We've made ours open source so we can quickly iterate on it, and so you can get an insight into how we work.

##### Our iOS style guides

- [Objective-C](https://github.com/theappbusiness/iOS-Style-Guide/blob/master/objective-c.md)
- [Swift](https://github.com/theappbusiness/iOS-Style-Guide/blob/master/swift.md)


These are modified forks from the [NYT](https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide) and [GitHub](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide) which have now been combined into one repo.

You can find the style guides for our other engineering teams [here](https://github.com/theappbusiness?utf8=âœ“&query=guide).
