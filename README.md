At [The App Business](https://theappbusiness.com) we believe in writing clean, clear, and consistent code within each of our engineering teams. One of the ways we do this is with our coding style guides. We decided to keep ours open source so that anyone in our team can make suggestions to it, and so everyone else can see how we work.

Here are our iOS style guides, we use one for [Objective-C](https://github.com/theappbusiness/tab-ios-style-guide/blob/master/objective-c.md) that we've had for a while, and one for [Swift](https://github.com/theappbusiness/tab-ios-style-guide/blob/master/swift.md) which we're still figuring out best practices for. 


* [Objective-C](https://github.com/theappbusiness/tab-ios-style-guide/blob/master/objective-c.md)
* [Swift](https://github.com/theappbusiness/tab-ios-style-guide/blob/master/swift.md)


These were both originally forks from the NYT and GitHub.
